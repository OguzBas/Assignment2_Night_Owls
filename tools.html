							<h2>Meetings</h2>
							<p>The group used Discord and Microsoft Teams to communicate with each other. We decided to have two meetings per week, on Wednesday and on Saturday. Two meetings per week was sufficient to primarily discuss and work collaboratively on the assignment. The meeting dates are: 
								<ul>
									<li>09/09/20 </li>
									<li>13/09/20 </li>
									<li>16/09/20 </li>
									<li>18/09/20 </li>
									<li>20/09/20 </li>
								</ul>

							<h2>GitHub Activities Log Reflection</h2>
							<p>At the start of the assignment, setting up the group GitHub did not take long. We allocated one person to organize and set up the GitHub repository and page. The log of activities on GitHub reflects the group’s work well as everyone contributed to editing the group’s website. The meetings held in MS teams were beneficial and allowed us to discuss and work on the group’s website in real time, and to get solutions to unanswered questions. Overall, although we started late on getting all the content on GitHub, the collaboration went smoothly and towards the submission deadline as everyone was aware of what they needed to accomplish.
