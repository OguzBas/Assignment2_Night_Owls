						<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
						<h3>What does it do? </h3>
						<p>Cyber security refers to the practise of safeguarding technology such as servers, computers, networks and electronic systems from breaches of data and malicious attacks. As defined by RAND, “the state-of-the-art in cyber security refers to the overview of flagrant risks, threats or policy issues that occur within the field of cybersecurity, as well as issue areas that are perceived to be overlooked by programmers or relevant communities. (Rand, 2019)” Moreover, Fifth Domain deliberates that there are two main phases in regard to the state of art in cyber security. Phase one involves the scanning of the cybersecurity field in order to identify and understand the threats presented. Whereas, the second phase refers to the action that is taken in response to combat the given threat (Fifth Domain, 2019). </p>
							<p>Cyber Security as of current, is largely abundant within all large organisations from banks, retailers and government organisations. Cyber security allows for businesses to have a safeguard on files, networks, firewalls and develop safety plans. Cyberattacks are ever changing and occur to organisations, customers and employees. As stated by Norton, these attacks may be created in the aims to destroy sensitive data and/or extort money (Norton 2020). Moreover, cyber security within businesses can provide multiple layers of protection within computers, devices, networks and programs. However, a strong cyber security system that possesses multiple layers of protection across computers, devices, networks and programs.</p>
								<p>As stated by Cisco, there are three main types of cyberthreats, these include attacks against confidentiality, integrity and availability (Cisco, 2018). Attacks against confidentiality refers to attacks that are intended to steal an individual's personal identity in the aims to steal banking or credit card information. Attacks on Integrity refers to individual or business-oriented sabotage, these are likely referred to as leaks. This is done in the aim to influence the public to lose trust / faith in a person and/or organisation. An attack on availability refers to an instance in which a user is blocked from accessing their own data and are held ransom until they paid a nominated fee. </p>
								<p>Moreover, the recent abundance of cloud technology, hardware authentication has played a significant role in the current advancements within the cyber security field. As the emergence of cloud base technology has become more abundant in recent times, the ability to share and store information remotely has made cybersecurity much stronger. The cloud has provided increased levels of security as it supplies both protections containing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, prevention technology and anti-penetration technology (ECPI, 2018). </p>
								<p>Additionally, hardware authentication has proved to allow for numerous advancements within the cyber security field. As explored by ECPI, “Intel is now using this technology where it combines a variety of hardware-enhanced factors simultaneously to validate a user’s identity” (ECPI, 2018). This in turn has strengthened the cyber security front as it maximises the information needed in order for a cyberthreat to have access to information. </p>
								<p>As the notion of ‘cyber security’ becomes more prevalent the use of machine learning and AI may grow alongside. The introduction of this will allow for the detection and alerting to organisations of potential cyberattacks. These advancements are also predicted to scan for ransomware which will limit the number of potential cyber-attacks. Adding to this, Forcepoint Cyber security, predicts that organisations will begin to shift from the use of breach indicators of compromise to the use of indicators of behaviour as malware and threats will become more advanced (Forcepoint, 2020). </p>

						<h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
						<p>As the field of cyber security grows as a whole, the threat of cyber-attacks grows alongside. As a result, the number of people in the cyber security field will significantly increase. As the New York Times predicts that “by 2021 there will be over 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions, up from just one million in early 2014” (New York Times, 2018). In agreeance with this, Justin Lawrence, from Yale University believes that the cyber security field will grow at a rate of 33.2% by 2028 as the number of cybersecurity crimes grow at a marginal rate. (CampusYale, 2019). </p>
							<p>Attila Tomascheck, a Cyber Security Researcher at Pro Privacy hypothesises that the future of cyber security will strongly rely on the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Tomascheck, elaborates that IoT and connected devices are growing at a burgeoning rate. He states that the ways in which we leave ourselves exposed to potential cyber-attacks continue to increase rapidly, as a result, human oriented systems do not have the capabilities to keep up with the ever-growing threats that are presented by these cyber threats (Disruptor Daily, 2020). </p>
								<p>This begs the question of the future of cyber security. As it stands many believe that the shortcoming future, presents a large number of prospect for people within the cyber security field, yet Tomascheck, foresees that the number of jobs within the industry will likely decline in the distant future as many, if not all positions will be replaced with AI intelligence which can regulate and monitor data and informational breaches. </p>

						<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
						<p>The prominence of ‘cyber security’ is highly beneficial for all individuals regardless of the level of internet use, as it protects your personal information, files and the stealing and selling or your personal information. Cyber Security, in day to day life protects my digital data through my network, safeguards my computer and devices from unauthorised users and access, attack and/or destruction. </p>
							<p>With this, the prevalence of cyber security threats will decrease as methods to minimise the potential data breaches will emerge and limit the threat to all. With this data, whether deemed important or not, lost or stolen can provide attackers with information which can be used to create phishing campaigns (make a fake identity) which can later be used to take out loans in your name, have your identity stolen or compromise your online accounts that rely on security questions. This can affect family and friends although is most common within the older generations (personally, my grandma). Moreover, this information can then be bought and provided to advertisers (ZDNET, 2020)</p>

							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
							<h3>What does it do? </h3>
							<p>The idea of machine learning comes from problems and difficulties that programmers have to solve or produce new algorithms to overcome these problems. If the problem is simple, it may not be hard for people to create algorithms. But, when it is a complex problem, it may take a long time to solve the problems and it may not be very accurate for the situation. The introduction of artificial intelligence now allows scientists and programmers to use a computer program to come up with new algorithms. This is called machine learning. And the current technology allows us to have really smart robots and machinery which can use artificial intelligence. </p>
								<p>Machine learning is basically the term given to the study of computers interacting with the outside world and coming up with new algorithms by itself. It focuses on experience to improve new algorithms then it uses that algorithms and uses data to have better experience and better algorithms. Machine learning is also called the study that allows the machines to bring up new algorithms without explicitly programmed. It is artificial intelligence that allows machines to be able to produce algorithms. Artificial intelligence can analyse big data very fast and it can give us more accurate outputs than people. So, we can say that machine learning is quicker and more accurate. It is this intelligence that allows the machine to make predictions and decide. </p>
									<p>When it comes to the environment where a computer program learns and how it learns, there are 3 main types of learning for the computer, although it is not restricted to these 3 types. First one is supervised learning. In the supervised learning, the computer is already given an input and shown which output to produce according to the input. Then, by this experience computers learn a general rule which it applies when mapping between inputs and outputs. And when it encounters with a different input it uses the rules that it already knows to produce the predicted outputs. Second type of learning is unsupervised learning. In the unsupervised learning, computers are not given any structure or rules. It is left with the environment alone and it is supposed to produce an algorithm by checking the inputs it has already got. So, this time the computer looks for pre-existing data which is not labelled or grouped. Then, the computer groups that data and tries to find a pattern according to the environment. Here is where the computer uses artificial intelligence. </p>
									<p>The third type of machine learning is reinforcement learning. Here, a computer is placed in an environment where it is supposed to do a certain task. Like the unsupervised learning, the computer is not given any pre-labelled data or structured data. Instead, computers are supposed to check pre-existing data and find a pattern to apply to the environment. It will, then, find some data and produce a pattern that it will compare with the environment. After comparing data and environment, it will find a balance and produce a new algorithm.</p>

							<h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
							<p>In our daily lives, especially if we are using the technology frequently and if we are working, we will get most of the advantage of machine learning and AI. Because as discussed above, AI will potentially affect the technology mostly, so we will be using smarter applications and programs. It means our daily tasks will be done easily. Our problems will be solved faster. As computers will help programmers and developers to come up with more accurate software and algorithms. Especially, developers do lots of surveys to get feedback from users, and if we can adapt computers to the user experience environment, this will also be helpful in terms of correcting mistakes and developing better applications. </p>
								<p>As people are slower than computers, computers will be able to produce more accurate products faster than humans. This means our problems will be solved faster and we would be able to produce better products. Until now, we used machinery to help us with labouring. Now, we can use computers to help us think, to help us solve problems and come up with new ideas. Literally, everything that happens in our environment can potentially change. However, it seems that machine learning is likely to change the technology and digital area mostly. It will produce new machinery to deal with our daily tasks such as lifting, cleaning and many more. It will also likely produce smarter mobile phone applications, games and some other applications to help us with cybersecurity. </p>
									<p>Potentially, machine learning and AI will affect most of us positively and some of us negatively. If we start with the negative side, as the computers do more jobs in terms of thinking and labour, people do less work. It means we will work less and think less. So, computers are replacing human activity. New inventions may affect young people and students negatively leaving them less work and less thinking and that may make them lazy. On the other hand, AI will produce more accurate products for the working people like doctors, police, teachers, and other workers. It will also help the elderly in terms of daily tasks. It will potentially change many jobs. By having complex and smart machinery, labouring load may reduce. As long as a machine can do what people do, people will be doing less job and this will reduce their working hours. Also, people will need to deal with technology more to adapt themselves to the new applications. Potentially, there will be more need for the technicians, and for the programmers. </p>

						<li><a href="https://xndyr.github.io/Assignment1/">Learn about Ahlyk Xandyr Beredo</a></li>
						<h3>Personal Information</h3>
						<p>My name is Ahlyk Xandyr Beredo (Student number s3781189) and I was born and raised in the Philippines. I finished up my primary and high-school years upto year 10 in 2016 and arrived and started living in Melbourne mid-2016. I have little knowledge on the IT field as we had an IT course in my school for 4 years including C++ and JavaScript. My hobbies and interests include playing basketball, listening to music, watching movies or shows, playing video games, and watching videos on how stuff works including new developments in technology and other related fields in my pastime.</p>
						<h3>The test outcomes</h3>
						<p>Myers-Briggs Test<br>
						The results of my Myers-Briggs test show that I have an INFJ or an "advocate" personality type. This personality type is regarded as rare as stated in the test website making up one percent of the whole population which means that for me this fits well with my actions, thoughts, and opinions generally speaking which I tend to try my best to see through my goals whilst having an important and lasting impact not only to myself but to other people as well.<br>
						Learning Style<br>
						Based on the learning style test I'm more of a pragmatist style learner, meaning that I need to be able to see how I could utilise what I've learned into practise in the real world. I like trying out new ideas and experimenting on it to test if it works or not. My other secondary, tertiary, and quaternary learning styles namely theorist, reflector, and activist respectively. This result of my learning style would influence my behaviour on a team as I learn through trying out new ideas and work well in discussions so I would be able to take advantage and learn from others as well in trying to complete a task.<br>
						Big Five Factors<br>
						The results from my big five factors show that agreeableness which is factor 3, is my highest raw score compared to the other factors. This means that I am friendly and optimistic which is a trait that is very useful especially when working with people in a team. My second highest raw score is factor 4 which is conscientiousness, which tells me that I am an individual who is careful and diligent which allows me to not recklessly decide on what to do with tasks especially under pressure. My third highest raw score is factor 1 which is extroversion. It remarks that people like me who score high on this factor are outgoing and social which is a good attribute to have in working with a team as I will not have too much of a problem interacting or introducing myself to my teammates and teammates would be able to easily approach me.</p>
